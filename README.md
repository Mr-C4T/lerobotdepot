# Feetech Family

Hardware in this family uses **Feetech motors**—specifically, the STS3215 series available in both 7.4V and 12V variants. These motors are popular for their balance between performance and cost:
- **7.4V Version:** Typically offers a stall torque of approximately 16.5 kg·cm at 6V. This option is often sufficient for basic robotics applications.
- **12V Version:** Delivers around 30 kg·cm of stall torque, providing increased power for more demanding tasks.
  
By standardizing on the STS3215, projects in the Feetech Family maintain similar power and control characteristics, ensuring compatibility across accessories and modules.

## Robot Arms:

### [TheRobotStudio/SO-ARM100](https://github.com/TheRobotStudio/SO-ARM100)

This **5 DOF arm** is the recommended arm to get started with LeRobot—especially the 7.4V version.

### [jess-moss/moss-robot-arms](https://github.com/jess-moss/moss-robot-arms)
This **5 DOF arm** is similar to the SO-ARM100 but uses only the gripper as a 3D printed part. It is recommended to build or purchase the SO100 arm instead. While the Moss v1 robot is still supported, it will be deprecated. Additionally, 3D-printed parts for the SO-ARM100 are now available for purchase if you don't have a printer.

# Dynamixel Family

Hardware in this family uses Dynamixel servo motors, which are considered more of an industry standard than Feetech motors.

## Robot Arms: <a name="robot-arms-dynamixel"></a>

### [jess-moss/koch-v1-1](https://github.com/jess-moss/koch-v1-1)

The Koch-v1-1 is a 5 DOF robotic arm. If you want to familiarise yourself with more industry standard Dynamixel servo motors, this project could be a good starting point. Compared to the SO-ARM100, you will have less torque and a more limited range of movement from its base.

## Bi-manual Arms: <a name="bi-manual-arms-dynamixel"></a>

### [ALOHA 2](https://aloha-2.github.io)


ALOHA 2 is a bimanual teleoperation system that uses two types of arms—a pair of smaller, ergonomically designed leader arms and two robust follower arms—to support coordinated dual-arm manipulation. Each arm offers **6 degrees of freedom (6 DOF)**, which provides an extensive range of motion for accessing various positions and orientations.

The system is designed for research in fine-grained bimanual manipulation. Its construction includes enhanced gripper mechanisms, a passive gravity compensation system, and a rigid frame that supports precise and repeatable operations for complex tasks. These advanced features and components are reflected in its higher cost compared to more basic robotic arm solutions.
